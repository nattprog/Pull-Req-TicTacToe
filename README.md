Workflow should be:

1. Create a new branch.
2. Duplicate the Play_TicTacToe_Here.py file. Rename it Match-[num].py or [name]vs[name].py etc.
3. In that new play file, add your move, and commit it to that branch.
4. Create a pull request to merge the branch into main, and assign it to your opponent!

Subsequent moves:
1. Create a new branch
2. Open your play file and add your move, and commit it to that branch.
3. Create a pull request to merge the branch into main, and assign it to your opponent!
